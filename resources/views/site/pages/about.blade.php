            <h1>About us </h1>
            <h4> Welcome to firebidder.com! We're a fun and exciting, fast-paced auction website.</h4>
            <p> You can win all sorts of popular products at incredibly low prices. Look at our homepage to see what products are up for five auction right now, and if one catches your eye, buy some bids <img src="images/about.jpg" alt="Smiley face" width="200" height="200" align="right"> for a low price! When you place a bid, we add a maximum of 10-20 seconds to the timer - to give someone else the chance to bid if they're interested. This is similar to the "Going Once... Twice...SOLD" approach of auctions.
                If no one else bids and the timer reaches zero, you've won a sweet deal on firebidder.com! If you don't win the auction, you never have to go away empty handed. Any time after you've placed your first bid in an auction, you can choose to buy the product for a discount using the Buy Now feature. This will help limit your losses so you don't have to leave all your bids on the table. You'll never have to pay more than the Value Price for any products on firebidder.com.
            </p>
